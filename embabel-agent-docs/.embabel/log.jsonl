{"request":"Make minimal changes to CSS to ensure that listingblock and <code> elements are visible not just whited out. Specifically:\n\n1. Check and update the CSS rules for `.listingblock pre`, `.listingblock pre[class]`, and inline `code` elements to ensure they have proper contrast and visibility.\n2. Add explicit color and background-color properties to inline `code` elements.\n3. Ensure that all code-related elements have `color: var(--code-text-color)` explicitly set.\n4.
