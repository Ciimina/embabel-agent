Tools DEFINITION

Two kinds in Embabel

==== Tool Groups

Embabel introduces the concept of a *tool group*.
This is a level of indirection between user intent and tool selection.
For example, we don't ask for Brave or Google web search: we ask for "web" tools, which may be resolved differently in different environments.

> Tools are deliberately focused.
Thus tool groups cannot be specified at agent level, but must be specified on individual actions.

==== Tools on Domain Objects
