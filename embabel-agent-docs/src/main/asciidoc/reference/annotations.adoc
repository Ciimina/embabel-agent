=== Annotation model

Embabel provides a Spring-style annotation model to define agents, actions, goals, and conditions.
This is the recommended model to use in Java, and remains compelling in Kotlin.

==== The `@Agent` annotation

==== The `@Action` annotation

==== The `@AchievesGoal` annotation

==== The `@Condition` annotation
