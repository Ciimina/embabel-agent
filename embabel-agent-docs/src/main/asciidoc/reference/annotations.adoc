=== Annotation model

Embabel provides a Spring-style annotation model to define agents, actions, goals, and conditions.
This is the recommended model to use in Java, and remains compelling in Kotlin.

==== The `@Agent` annotation

==== The `@Action` annotation

===== Parameters

`@Action` methods must have at least one parameter.

Parameters fall in two categories:

* _Domain objects_.
These are the usual inputs.
* _Infrastructure objects_.

===== Handling of return types

Action methods normally return a single domain object.

Nullable return types are allowed.

===== Action method implementation

Using PromptRunner etc.

==== The `@AchievesGoal` annotation

The `@AchievesGoal` annotation can be added to an `@Action` method to indicate that the completion of the action achieves a specific goal.

==== The `@Condition` annotation
