=== Templates

Embabel supports Jinja templates for generating prompts and `PromptContributors`.

To do this, your agent or other type should declare a `TemplateRenderer` parameter, which will be provided by the platform and injected by Spring.

TIP: Don't rush to externalize prompts.
In modern languages with multi-line strings, it's often easier to keep prompts in the codebase.
Externalizing them can sacrifice type safety and lead to complexity and maintenance challenges.
