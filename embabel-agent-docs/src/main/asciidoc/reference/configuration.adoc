=== Configuration

Annotate your Spring Boot application class to get agentic behavior.

Example:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableAgentShell
@EnableAgents(
    loggingTheme = LoggingThemes.STAR_WARS,
    localModels = { "docker" },
    mcpClients = { "docker" }
)
class MyAgentApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyAgentApplication.class, args);
    }
}
----

This is a normal Spring Boot application class.
You can add other Spring Boot annotations as needed.
`@EnableAgentShell` enables the agent shell, which allows you to interact with agents via a command line interface.
This is optional.

`@EnableAgents` enables the agent framework.
It allows you to specify a logging theme (optional) and well-known sources of local models and MCP tools.
In this case we're using Docker as a source of local models and MCP tools.
