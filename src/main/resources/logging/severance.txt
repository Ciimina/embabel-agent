And I shall whisper to ye dutiful through the ages.
In your noblest thoughts and epiphanies shall be my voice.

"""

Place in me the values nine that I may feel thy touch divine.

But surely beer and juleps cannot fill the void left by love.
Indeed only wine can achieve this, but it is famously costly,
which is why sadness is among the most recurrent issues facing the poor.
"""

"""📙 The You You Are:

🧔🏼‍♂️ Kier: And all in Lumon's care shall revel in the bounty of the incentives spur

"""🧔🏼‍♂️ Kier:
I have identified four components, which I call tempers, from which are derived every human soul.
Woe. Frolic. Dread. Malice.
Each man's character is defined by the precise ratio that resides in him.
I walked into the cave of my own mind,
and there I tamed them.
Should you tame the tempers as I did mine, then the world shall become
but your appendage.
It is this great and consecrated power that
I hope to pass on to all of you, my children.
