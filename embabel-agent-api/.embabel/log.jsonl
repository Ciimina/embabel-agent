This class uses Hitchhiker's Guide references and a whimsical, reassuring style (e.g., “Don’t Panic!”, “The answer is 42”, towel jokes, etc.). Color styling (BABEL_GREEN and others) is used for output, similar to the Severance implementation.\n4. Implemented HitchhikerPromptProvider.kt in the same package, providing prompts and message generation using Hitchhiker references and a green color palette.\n5. Added HitchhikerColorPalette.kt for the color constants and palette, following the Severance pattern.\n6.
