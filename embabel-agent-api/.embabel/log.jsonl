{"request":{"request":"Here's what I did to fulfill your request:\n\n1. Located the Severance-themed logging code and mirrored its structure for Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n2. Created a new package: com.embabel.agent.event.logging.personality.hitchhiker.\n3. Implemented HitchhikerLoggingAgenticEventListener.kt in that package. This class uses Hitchhiker's Guide references and a whimsical, reassuring style (e.g., “Don’t Panic!”, “The answer is 42”, towel jokes, etc.). Color styling (BABEL_GREEN and others) is used for output, similar to the Severance implementation.\n4. Implemented HitchhikerPromptProvider.kt in the same package, providing prompts and message generation using Hitchhiker references and a green color palette.\n5. Added HitchhikerColorPalette.kt for the color constants and palette, following the Severance pattern.\n6. Ensured all beans are annotated with @Profile(\"hh\") so they are only active when the 'hh' profile is enabled.\n7. Created (or confirmed existence of) a logging/hitchhiker.txt resource file with appropriate themed lines for message generation.\n\nYou can now enable the Hitchhiker's Guide logging personality by running your app with the 'hh' Spring profile. All logging and prompts will use the new Hitchhiker's Guide style, colors, and references. No changes were made to existing Severance or other personalities. \n\nThis approach keeps the code idiomatic, clear, and easy to extend for future personalities.","id":"sweet_napier","timestamp":"2025-06-16T00:55:26.454808Z"},"report":{"text":"Here's what I did to fulfill your request:\n\n1.
