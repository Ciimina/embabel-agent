  Rod Johnson, Embabel. Creator of Spring

brief: >
  Demonstrate how Kotlin and Spring are the ideal modern server side stack.
  
  We're not just looking backward, but forward. This deck is generated by
  an agent framework written in Kotlin using Spring.
  The JVM has a big place in the future of programming.
  
  While modern Java has improved a lot, Kotlin remains better.
  
  In the last 10 years, I've done a lot of languages:
  [make this a table]
  Scala - Elegant language, too clever for mortals
  TypeScript - Love the language, but Node is messy
  Python - Getting better but still thumbs its nose at computer science.
  Modern Java - I hadn't done for >10 years, and it's improved a lot. Spring is so nice after Node and Python ecosystem.
  Kotlin - The best of both worlds
  
  Provide all examples from the given codebase if possible, not via web search.

  Provide examples of Kotlin reification and extension functions.
  Show how Spring @Service works naturally with with Kotlin classes
  Show how Kotlin data classes work well with Spring @ConfigurationProperties annotation.
  Show how Java code can consume Kotlin code in a natural way: see StarNewsFinder.java.
  
  Add slides on how the Kotlin compiler "open" is configured in pom.xml and how
  it helps avoid errors with Spring.
  
  Explain how this presentation has been created by Embabel, written in Kotlin and based on Spring.
  Explain the core concepts of Embabel, as explained in README.md.
  Specifically distinguished by:
  - planning toward goals, which enables extensiblity without modification
  - rich domain model
  
  Show how the file named 'kotlinconf_presentation.yml' in the project (use findFiles and readFile), 
  lays out the narrative for this presentation.
  
  Explain the implementation of the PresentationMaker Kotlin class. 
  Draw a GraphViz diagram of how the class works.
  
  Conclude with a call to action: experience the future of agentic systems
  by trying Embabel; it's an example of Spring + Kotlin in action.
