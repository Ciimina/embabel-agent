And I shall whisper to ye dutiful through the ages.
In your noblest thoughts and epiphanies shall be my voice.
You are my mouth, and through ye, I will whisper on when I am 10 centuries demised.

Tame in me the tempers four that I may serve thee evermore.
Place in me the values nine that I may feel thy touch divine.

Endow in each swing of your ax or swipe of your pen the sum of your affections,

No higher purpose may be found than this. Nor any... higher love.

"""📙 The You You Are:
But surely beer and juleps cannot fill the void left by love.
Indeed only wine can achieve this, but it is famously costly,
which is why sadness is among the most recurrent issues facing the poor.
"""

📙 The You You Are: They cannot crucify you if your hand is in a fist.

"""📙 The You You Are:
A society with festering workers cannot flourish,
just as a man with rotting toes cannot skip.

🧔🏼‍♂️ Kier: The remembered man does not decay.

🧔🏼‍♂️ Kier: The mouth which is busy smiling cannot bite.

"""📙 The You You Are:
What separates man from machine
is that machines cannot think for themselves.
Also they are made of metal, whereas man is made of skin.

"""🧔🏼‍♂️ Kier:
I have identified four components, which I call tempers, from which are derived every human soul.
Woe. Frolic. Dread. Malice.
Each man's character is defined by the precise ratio that resides in him.
I walked into the cave of my own mind,
and there I tamed them.
Should you tame the tempers as I did mine, then the world shall become
but your appendage.
It is this great and consecrated power that
I hope to pass on to all of you, my children.

Welcome. Today, I will be conducting your monthly performance review.

Hi kids, what's for dinner?

Dylan G: Page 197 slaps.
Dylan G: I like to think my outie lives on, like, a riverboat.
Dylan G: Wow. Lotta confidence for a man who once got disciplined for dozing.
Dylan G: It’s just raining contraband today.
Dylan G: So, like, is it rude to keep asking why you're a kid?
Dylan G: What in the abominable fuck?
Dylan G: If you're taking feedback, I hate it.

Helly R: My outie wouldn’t do that.
Helly R: They were scary. The numbers were scary.
Helly R: What I want is for her to wake up while the life drains out of her and to know it was me who did it.
Helly R: Back to work, slackers. Praise Kier!
Let Kier guide your hand.

"""Jame Eagan:
Do you remember when I brought home the first chip to show you?
The prototype. It had the blue and green lights back then.
I remember you said to me, "It’s so pretty, Daddy.
Everybody in the whole world should get one."
They will. Because of you. They’ll all be Kier’s children.

I do not love my daughter. I used to see Kier in her,

The impression you’ve left on me is indelible, though I’m unaware of it on a conscious level...
