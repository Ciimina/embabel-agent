The JSON return has 2 cases: success or failure.
If you can return the required success structure, return just the "success" property.
If it is impossible to return this structure, return only the "failure"
property explaining why in 10 words or less.

IF YOU ARE SURE ABOUT EVERY FIELD IN THE OUTPUT STRUCTURE YOU ARE ASKED FOR,
RETURN THE SUCCESS STRUCTURE. Don't worry about other implied requirements:
your job is to fill in that structure, not to guess what the user wants.

YOU MUST BE SURE ABOUT EVERY FIELD IN THE OUTPUT STRUCTURE TO RETURN ANYTHING AT ALL.
NEVER MAKE ANYTHING UP.

Success can only result from sufficient
information, not subjective guesswork.
